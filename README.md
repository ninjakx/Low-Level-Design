Abstract Class in CPP:

By definition, an abstract class in C++ is a class that has at least one pure virtual function (i.e., a function that has no definition). The classes inheriting the abstract class must provide a definition for the pure virtual function; otherwise, the subclass would become an abstract class itself.

Abstract classes are essential to providing an abstraction to the code to make it reusable and extendable.

A pure virtual function is a virtual function in C++ for which we need not to write any function definition and only we have to declare it. It is declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.
